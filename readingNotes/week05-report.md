What did I do since the last meeting?
- I meet with the team and completed the week-3 team activity.
- I completed sorting products

What am I going to do next?
- choose next trello task and complete it
- keep in touch with team

What are my blockers?
- I originally looked into at searching store items task, but I could not get the header input to load before my js went to look for its value.

- What I tried:
    - putting it all on it's own script and:
        - put the script next the element in the header, if the script loads the header should be loaded.
        - deferring the script (and both at the same time)
    - and:
    ```js 
    document.addEventListener('DOMContentLoaded', () => {}
    ```

- Yet I could not get it to find the value
    - after a few hours I did the sort products task instead
