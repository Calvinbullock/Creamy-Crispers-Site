What did I do since the last meeting?
- I meet with the team and completed the week-8 team activity.
- merged a few pull requests
- completed the item search trello ticket

What am I going to do next?
- choosing my next task

What are my blockers?
- having trouble adding the search script to every page the header is on
    - tried adding the script right to the header html -- FAIL
    - tried injecting it to the page with js -- worked on local not in
      production
    - production still not working...
